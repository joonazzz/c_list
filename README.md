# c_list
Generic linked list for holding any data for C language. 

Tired of always writing Linked list implementation for your struct? Me too,
Thats why I wrote this linked list that can hold any data using void* data
pointers. There is also "re-entrant" (ie. thread-safe) version of this linked
list using pthread mutex locks.

Code is very simple and very easy to use. See main.c for example.
